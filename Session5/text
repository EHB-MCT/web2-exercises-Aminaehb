Exercise 1:
1. Make a test.js
   1.1 Write a small function ex: let a = 10;
                                  let b = 10;
                                  console.log(a+b); 
    1.2 Answer: Run in terminal to see the answer --> node test.js 
    1.3 Clear: cntrl c to clear or write clear

Exercise 2:
1. Make a modules.js
2. import fileRead by (import * as fs from 'fs/promises';)
3. Write the fuction by await 
    3.1 Because await comes with async --> change from js to mjs (no need async in mjs)
          --> modules.mjs
4. Execute code by package.json
  4.1 change mjs to js
  4.2 then in terminale of boardgames.json you put npm int (to get package.json)
  4.3 in js your remove the catch error & try with brackets
  4.4 then execute in terminale --> node modules.js
      -->  error (await & import)
  4.5  Add to your package.json a "type":"module"



5. How to execute the id in the terminale
   5.1 console.log(data) in comment zetten
   5.2 for loop maken => for (let id in data)
                         console.log(id); --> in terminale (node modules.js) you will see 3 id's
                         of console.log(data[id]);  --> in terminale you will see    the                            key first then the value
