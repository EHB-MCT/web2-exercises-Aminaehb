fetch = asynchrone javascript --> it asks to retrieve data
      = async function returns a Promise object.
const = (constant) defines a variable as unchangeable --> document.getElementById = img (id in html)


STEP 1: try to see if it console.logs
--> it worked!

STEP 2: I first made a simple fetch code to see if my api url can get fetched
etch the api
      1. first fetch the api
      2. then a promise (.then) --> consolelog response = reponse in console = false
      3. convert into json response = response.json
      4. to catch errors is also very important = promise .catch the error and when we consolelog it I need to see the word "ERROR"
--> it never worked = it woudl always say (response undefined) or {"message":"You are not authorized."}
--> which I think means I need to be a member of the group

=> just to see if there wasn'y a problem with my console I made a new fetch api with random pictures of cats

STEP 3: first I am gonna try it with an api that gives random picturs of cats 
      1. async function = getRandomPictures --> declare also underneath in the code 
      2. then fetch the api
      3. first promise (.then) --> consolelog response = reponse in console = true = url
      4. convert into json response = response.json
      5. second promise (.then) --> consolelog the data  => in console we got a first object
      6. now that i see a url in the console we need to return the data of that url in our id (img)
      7. img source = the first object in the console data = [O].url) --> with that we have our picture
      8. to catch errors is also very important = promise .catch the error and when we consolelog it I need to see the word "ERROR"
--> it worked = everytime you reload the page you see random pictures of cats
